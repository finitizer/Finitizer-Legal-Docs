## 1. Introduction
Finitizer is committed to protecting your privacy. This Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and disclose information. It forms part of the Terms of Service.

## 2. Information We Collect
We may collect different types of information from or about you, including both personal information and non-personal data, when you use Finitizer’s website and Services. The types of information we collect include:
•	Information You Provide to Us: You may choose to provide personal information to Finitizer when using our Services or communicating with us. For example:
•	Contact and Account Information: When you fill out a form on our site (such as a contact/consultation request or newsletter signup) or if you create an account, we may collect information such as your name, company name, email address, phone number, city, country, and any other information you choose to provide Support and Communications: If you contact us directly (via email, contact form, or phone), we will receive the contents of your message and any other information you choose to provide (such as your contact information and any attachments).
•	Payment Information: If you decide to purchase a paid Service (in the future when available), we or our third-party payment processor may collect payment details from you. This may include the billing name and address, and a payment method (e.g., credit card number and expiration date). Note: Finitizer uses reputable third-party payment processors to handle credit card transactions; we do not store your full credit card information on our own systems.
•	User Contributions: If any interactive features (like forums, comments, or feedback forms) are available and you voluntarily provide content (such as posting a comment or testimonial), we will collect whatever information you include in those submissions. (Be mindful that information you post publicly can be seen by others.)
•	Information We Collect Automatically: When you visit our website or use the Services, we (or our service providers) may automatically collect certain information about your device and usage of the Services. This information may include:
•	Usage Data: Details of how you use our website and tools, such as the pages or tools you access, the date and time of your visits, the duration of use, and referring/exit pages. For example, we might log that you used the BigQuery SQL Analyzer tool on a certain date.
•	Device and Network Information: We collect information about the device and internet connection you use to access the Services. This can include your IP address, browser type and version, operating system, device identifiers, and network information.
•	Cookies and Similar Technologies: We use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons or pixels) to collect information about your interactions with our site. Cookies are small text files stored on your browser that help us recognize you and remember your preferences. They also help us gather analytics about our site usage. For example, we may use Google Analytics or similar tools that set cookies to collect usage data (which may include your IP address and browsing actions on our site). See the Cookies and Tracking section below for more details on our use of cookies and your choices. Information from Third Parties: We generally collect information directly from you. If in the future we partner with third-party services or you integrate third-party accounts with our Services, we might receive certain information from those third parties. For instance, if you choose to log in via a third-party identity provider or if you grant us read-access to a cloud provider account for cost analysis, we would receive information as authorized by you. We will inform you at the time of such integrations what data may be collected. (As of the Last Updated date of this Policy, users primarily provide data directly through our tools rather than via third-party integrations.)
How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect for the following purposes, consistent with the basis of processing as required under applicable law (such as obtaining your consent, fulfilling a contract, or pursuing our legitimate business interests). Specifically, we may use your information to:
•	Provide and Maintain the Services: We process your information to operate our Services, fulfill your requests, and deliver results. For example, if you input data into one of our optimization tools, we use that data to perform the analysis and return results to you. If you create an account, we use your registration details to create and manage your account.
•	Communicate with You: We may use your contact information to respond to your inquiries, send confirmations or technical notices, and provide customer support. If you request information about our services or sign up for a newsletter, we will use your contact details to communicate with you. We may also send you important updates or alerts related to the Services (for example, policy changes or security notifications).
•	Provide Service Updates and Marketing (with consent): We might send you informational content about new features, newsletters, or promotional communications about Finitizer products and services. You will have the option to opt-out from marketing emails at any time. We will only send you marketing communications in accordance with applicable law, and we will seek your consent where required (for instance, if law requires explicit consent to send email marketing).
•	Improve and Develop Our Services: We use the data (especially aggregated and analytics information) to understand how our Services are used and to make improvements. For example, usage data and feedback help us troubleshoot issues, optimize user experience, and develop new tools or features. We also analyze trends and user preferences to improve the performance, security, and functionality of our platform. Wherever feasible, we use anonymized or aggregated information for these purposes, so it does not identify you personally.
•	Ensure Security and Prevent Misuse: Information (like IP addresses, device info, and usage logs) is used to protect our Services and our users. We monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and ensure users are complying with our Terms. This helps us detect, prevent, and address fraud, breach of our Terms, or other activities that might be illegal or harmful.
•	Legal Compliance: We may process your personal information as required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, subpoenas, or legal processes. For example, we may retain transaction records to meet financial reporting obligations or use and disclose information to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, such as to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
•	Other Legitimate Business Purposes: We may use information for other legitimate purposes consistent with the context in which it was collected, with your consent, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. For instance, we may use certain data to administer and manage our business (such as invoicing and accounting if you’re a paying customer) or in the course of a business transaction (like due diligence in case of a merger).
How We Share or Disclose Information
Finitizer understands the importance of keeping your information private. We are not in the business of selling your personal information. We only share or disclose your information in the following circumstances:
•	With Service Providers and Partners: We may share information with trusted third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf to help us run our business and provide the Services. This includes, for example:
•	Hosting and Infrastructure: We may use cloud hosting providers or data center services to store or process data (e.g., our website hosting or database storage).
•	Analytics Providers: Third-party analytics tools (like Google Analytics) that help us understand usage patterns. These providers may receive information about your device and interactions with our site (as described in the Information Collected Automatically section).
•	Payment Processors: If you purchase Paid Service, we use third-party payment processors (such as Stripe or similar) to securely process payment transactions. These processors will handle your payment information in accordance with strict data security standards.
•	Email/Communication Tools: We might use an email service provider or customer relationship management (CRM) platform to send communications or manage user inquiries.
When we share information with service providers, it is only to the extent necessary for them to perform services on our behalf. They are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them, consistent with this Privacy Policy.
•	Within Our Corporate Group: If Finitizer in the future has any subsidiaries, parent company, or affiliates, we may share information among them for internal administrative purposes and to provide the Services to you. All such entities will honor the commitments in this Privacy Policy.
•	Business Transfers: If Finitizer is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be disclosed or transferred as part of that transaction. We would ensure that any acquiring entity is bound by terms substantially similar to this Privacy Policy and that they only use your personal information as permitted by applicable law.
•	Legal Requirements and Safety: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
•	Comply with a legal obligation, such as a court order, subpoena, or other lawful process.
•	Protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Finitizer, our users, or the public. This includes enforcing our Terms of Service or other agreements or investigating potential violations thereof.
•	Detect or prevent fraud, security, or technical issues (for example, exchanging information with other companies or organizations for fraud protection and risk reduction).
•	With Your Consent: In cases where we want to share your information for purposes not covered by this Privacy Policy, we will request your consent. For example, if we ever wish to use a testimonial from you publicly, we would obtain your permission. If you instruct us to share your information with a third party (for example, if you integrate our Service with another tool and ask us to send data to that tool), we will do so with your consent.
No Sale of Personal Data: We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for their own marketing or monetary benefit. In the past 12 months (or since our founding), we have not sold any personal data and have no plans to do so.
Cookies and Tracking Technologies
We use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website to provide, personalize, and improve our Services.
•	What Are Cookies: Cookies are small data files placed on your device when you visit a website. They serve a variety of functions, like enabling certain features, remembering your preferences, or analyzing how you use the site. Some cookies are “session cookies” which means they are deleted when you close your browser, while others are “persistent cookies” that remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them.
•	How We Use Cookies: Finitizer uses cookies for several reasons:
•	Essential Cookies: These are necessary for our website to function properly. For example, if we have a login system or a tool that needs to remember inputs during a session, essential cookies might be used.
•	Analytics Cookies: We use these to collect information about how visitors use our site. This helps us understand which pages are popular, how users navigate through the site, and if they encounter errors. We typically use third-party analytics tools (like Google Analytics) for this, which may set their own cookies. The information collected is generally aggregated and not intended to identify you personally. It includes data like which pages you visited, how long you stayed, and how you arrived at our site.
•	Preference Cookies: These cookies remember your choices to provide a more personalized experience. For instance, if our site supports multiple languages or has settings you can save, preference cookies would store those selections, so you don’t have to re-enter them.
•	Marketing/Advertising Cookies: At this time, Finitizer is not heavily engaged in advertising, but if we run any marketing campaigns or re-targeting ads, cookies or pixels might be used to track the effectiveness of those campaigns. These cookies could record that you visited our site and may be used to show you Finitizer ads on other websites or platforms (e.g., Google or LinkedIn ads). We will update our Privacy Policy if our use of marketing cookies becomes significant and ensure compliance with any consent requirements.
•	Your Choices for Cookies: When you first visit our site, you may see a banner or notice about cookie usage (depending on applicable laws). You have the right to accept or reject non-essential cookies. Most web browsers also allow you to control cookies through browser settings. You can set your browser to refuse all or some cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you disable or refuse cookies, some parts of our site may become inaccessible or not function properly (for example, an interactive tool might require cookies to remember inputs between pages).
•	Do Not Track: Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” (DNT) feature that lets you signal that you do not want your online activities tracked. There is currently no industry standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, so our site does not respond differently to browsers with DNT enabled. We continue to monitor developments around DNT and will revisit this policy if a standard emerges.
Data Security
We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration, and destruction. These measures include technical, administrative, and physical safeguards. For instance, our website may use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted between your browser and our site, and we restrict access to personal data to those employees or contractors who need it to perform their job duties, subject to confidentiality obligations.

However, please understand that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You should also take steps to secure your own information; for example, protect your account credentials and avoid sharing sensitive information in unprotected channels. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you suspect a security issue or unauthorized access to your account), please contact us immediately so we can investigate.
Data Retention
We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, and as needed to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. The exact period of retention will depend on the type of information and the reasons why we collected it. For example:
•	If you create an account or engage in our services, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with services. If you delete your account or it becomes inactive, we may anonymize or securely delete personal data associated with your account after a reasonable period, unless we need to keep it for legal reasons.
•	Information provided via contact forms or support requests may be kept as long as necessary to address your request and for a short period thereafter in case of follow-up, or longer if necessary for our internal record-keeping.
•	We may retain aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified data (which is not associated with an identifiable individual) indefinitely for analysis and improvement of our services.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete it or de-identify it. If deletion is not immediately feasible (for example, because the data is stored in backup archives), we will securely store the data and isolate it from further processing until deletion is possible.

## 11. Changes to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or other factors. When we update the policy, we will change the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document. If the changes are significant, we may also provide more prominent notice, such as on our website homepage or via email notification to registered users, prior to the change becoming effective.
We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. Your continued use of the Services after any update to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of the changes, to the extent permitted by law.
